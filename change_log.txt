CHANGELOG
Date: 2024-12-22
Project: PolyForge3D

Changes:
Renderer Ownership
Renderer now owns wgpu::Instance, removing lifetime dependencies.
Simplified Renderer by removing lifetime parameters.
Updated Renderer::new to reflect ownership of wgpu::Instance.

Error Handling
Added PolyForgeError with variants:
RendererNotInitialized for uninitialized renderer issues.
SurfaceCreationFailed(CreateSurfaceError) to wrap wgpu surface errors.
Other(String) for general error handling.
Updated create_window_surface to propagate errors using map_err.

Surface Creation
Resolved lifetime issues with wgpu::Surface.
Refactored create_window_surface to properly store surfaces without conflicts.
Removed improper use of the ? operator on non-Result values.

Next Steps
Resolve Lifetime Issues:
Investigate and align lifetimes between Renderer, wgpu::Instance, and wgpu::Surface.
